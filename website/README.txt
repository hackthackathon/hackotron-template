This is Overflow, a single page responsive site template by me, AJ, for HTML5 UP.
As you can tell it's a bit unusual (it was inspired by a flowchart I was working
on a few months back), but I think it'd make for a pretty cool portfolio. Includes
a pop-up gallery, styling for all basic page elements, a handy configuration
(see the top of js/init.js), and some experimental stuff I've been messing with
lately (like the parallax background effect).

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
